# Memory Game : Avengers time.

## Goals:
### Every card as an equal one. The goal its to find the pair to all cards 😎

## Rules:
### #1 > The game starts with all cards FLiped for 4 secconds (so you can check and try to memorize all the positions) and you start with 5 hearts.
### #2 > If when you click at one card it will remain Fliped till you click on another.
### #3 > If the both fliped cards are equal, they will remain fliped till the end of the game. 🎉
### #4 > If the both fliped cards are different, they will unFlip after 3 secconds and you will lose a heart. 💔
### #5 > If you end up with all your hearts you lose the game 😭
### #6 > If you find the pair of hearts you'll receive 2 extra hearts ❤️❤️ (my tip would be to find them right at the beginning, so you jump to 7 lifes)


## Win / Lose:
### If you completed the goal you win the game. 🎉🥳🎉
### If you end up with no hearts you lose. 🤦‍♂️

## Reseting it:

### To start a new game you just need to click on the button at the superior left side of the window.
